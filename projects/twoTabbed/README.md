twoTabbed
=========

This is the default Titanium two tabbed app created with Alloy. This app should be shown in conjunction with the [twoTabbedTraditional](https://github.com/tonylukasavage/alloy_demos/tree/master/projects/twoTabbedTraditional) app to show the much improved organization and code reduction in Alloy versus traditional Titanium development. The app shows a clear separation between UI, style, and logic and about a 50% code reduction. 

Requirements
------------

* Titanium SDK: 3.0.0.GA
* Alloy 0.3.4
* Platforms: Android, iOS, Mobileweb
