bookSearchWidget
================

This very small app shows how a single line of markup can inject a lot of functionality into an Alloy app via widgets. When demoing this app I generally highlight a few things:

* The fact that it only takes a single line of markup
* How to use the **app/config.json** file to add the widget's dependency to the project
* How you can use the widget's **widget.json** file to add other widget's as dependencies, allowing you to create complex widgets from simpler ones
* Mention that you can also expose a programmatic interface from the widget

Requirements
------------

* Titanium SDK 3.0.0.GA
* Alloy 0.3.4
* Platforms: Android, iOS, Mobileweb
