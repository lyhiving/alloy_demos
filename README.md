Alloy Demos
===========

A small collection of Appcelerator's Alloy MVC framework demo material. Feel free to use them in demos, presentations, etc... 

Projects
--------

Ready-to-run [demo apps](https://github.com/tonylukasavage/alloy_demos/tree/master/projects) showing off various aspects of Alloy. These range from very simple, single function demos to more complete apps, like the [todo]() sample. Be aware of the following:

* The Titanium, Alloy, and platform requirements and testing level should be included with the README.md in each project. I make no claims or guarantees about the stability of these demos outside those parameters.
* These demos generally represent a point in time in Alloy's development and are just here for ease of use and distribution. Updates will likely be few and far between. For udpate to date content, check out the Alloy repository's [test app section](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps) which has far more samples that should always work with the latest version of Alloy.
* Make sure to test these functionally. As I stated, these won't be updated a lot, so be sure they are working as expected in your current environment before presenting them.
* Use at your own risk.

### Contributions

Want to add a demo project? Submit a pull request with your project in it. Be sure it includes a README.md with the following information:

* A brief description of the app and what functionality of Alloy it aims to demonstrate
* Titanium SDK
* Alloy version
* Platforms supported (i.e., Android, iOS, Mobileweb)
* Any other requirements to run (i.e., ACS or OAuth keys, network resources, an open mind)

Make no assumptions about the supported versions. List **_only_** versions you have actually tested against.
